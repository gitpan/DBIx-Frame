Installing DBIx::Frame
======================

Installing this software is easy:

  perl Makefile.pl
  make
  make test
  make install

Creating a DBIx::Frame Database
===============================

(Assuming you're working with mysql, anyway, which is all that this
presently supports.)

0.  Install the database software

	Refer to http://www.mysql.com, or ask your local system
	administrator.

1.  Create the database

	This is probably best done with 'mysql_setpermission'.  Read the
	manual pages before you start.  You will need:

		- A database name
		- A username that can connect to it administratively
		- A username that can connect to it as a guest

2.  Design your tables.

	Documentation for this is explained in the DBIx::Frame manual
	pages (or 'pod2text Frame.pm | less')

3.  Create the tables.

	- Use 'dbixframe_create.pl' to create the tables.
	  - Edit the options to use the proper class
	  - Run the script - 'dbixframe_create.pl -c -a'

4.  Create the administration interface.

	'dbixframe.cgi' is the actual script to do the administration, but
	you'll want to populate your html() functions in order to make
	this useful.  Just keep in mind a) usability and b) offering
	everything you might conceivably want to change.

5.  Create the user interface.

	This is outside the scope of the actual documentation, except in
	as much as you've pretty much got an API for it.  Just write some
	scripts and programs to choose print what information you want, 
	and reterive it with the admin API.

	(You'll want to use the 'guest' user for this one.)
