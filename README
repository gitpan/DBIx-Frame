DBIx::Frame - a perl module for creating and maintaining DBI frameworks
=======================================================================

DBIx::Frame is an extension of the standard DBI perl module, designed
around mysql, and used to create and maintain frameworks for databases.
It has query logging, and a standardized interface for standard SQL 
statements like 'update' and 'insert' that doesn't require understanding 
SQL to any great degree.  Ideally, the user or developer shouldn't have to 
know too much SQL to be able to administer a database.  On the other hand,
it does require a certain setup that isn't necessarily easy to pick up,
and isn't standard SQL - with all the problems that this entails.

Prerequisites
=============

You must have the following modules installed:

  DBI		   v1.14	(older might work, but 1.14 is known to work)
  HTML::FormRemove v0.10 	(supplied with package)

You'll probably also want drivers for whatever database you're using (ie
mysql).  

Installation Notes
==================
Installing this software is easy:

  perl Makefile.pl
  make
  make test
  make install

Documentation
=============

All the documentation should be kept in the manual pages.  If you want to 
read it in place, 'pod2text Frame.pm | more' ought to cover you.
